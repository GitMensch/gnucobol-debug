**Features**
* Setting breakpoints
* Continue, Stop, Restart actions
* Variables pane

**Requirements**
* GnuCOBOL `cobc` installed
* GNU Debugger `gdb` installed

## Usage
When your `launch.json` config is set up, you can debug or execute your COBOL program. 
Pick `GnuCOBOL debugger` from the dropdown on the Debug pane in VS Code. Press the Play button or `F5` to debug or `Ctrl+F5` to execute.

The debugger uses C sourcecode generated by the compiler upon each debugging session. If the sourcemap isn't accurate or you see any other issues, please make a bug-report.

## Roadmap
- Mac and Windows
- Breakpoint Step Over
- Breakpoint Step Into
- Breakpoint Step Out
